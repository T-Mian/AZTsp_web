    The MIG welding method is based on the use of an inert gas, such as argon, which protects the
    welding area from reacting with the surroundings. It is a fast and effective metal joining technique,
    especially when welding non-ferrous metals such as aluminum or copper. Thanks to precise
    regulation of current and gas, we are able to ensure accurate, strong and durable welds.

        <p class='description'>The MIG method, also known as inert gas welding, involves powering a conductive welding wire
          melted in a welding torch with electrical current. At the same time, an inert gas is supplied to the
          welding area, most often argon or a mixture of argon with carbon dioxide or nitrogen oxide, which
          protects the molten metal drops from oxidation in the atmosphere.

          <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <p class='description' style="padding-left: 5%;">
          The MIG method is fast and effective, which makes it ideal for welding larger surfaces or in series
          production.<br>  It is suitable for welding a variety of metals and their alloys, including carbon steel,
          stainless steel, aluminum and copper.<br>  The welding process is relatively simple and easy to learn,
          allowing you to achieve results quickly.<br>

        <p class='description'>The MAG method, also known as active gas welding, is similar to the MIG method, with the
          difference that instead of pure inert gas, a mixture of inert gases with the addition of active gases,

          High quality welds: The MAG method allows you to obtain perfect welds even at higher welding
          speeds.<br>
           Resistance to pollution: The addition of active gases increases the resistance of the weld to atmospheric pollution.<br>
           Application in various conditions: This method is suitable for welding both in industrial and outdoor conditions.

    TiG (Tungsten Inert Gas) is a method that uses electrically heated tungsten electrodes and an inert
    gas such as argon. This is a popular technique in welding stainless steel, aluminum and other metals
    with low thermal conductivity. It is characterized by aesthetic, clean and precise welds, ideal for
    applications requiring a high-quality finish.
